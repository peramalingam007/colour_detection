# üé® Colour Detection using OpenCV & Streamlit

This is a **Color Detection Application** built for a hackathon, using **OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, and Streamlit**. It detects colors in images, videos, or real-time webcam feeds, highlighting them with bounding boxes and providing detailed outputs.

---

## üöÄ Features
- **Multiple Color Detection**: Identifies Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange, and Purple in images, videos, or webcam feeds.
- **Bounding Boxes & Labels**: Draws bounding boxes around detected regions with color names and RGB values.
- **Expanded Color Support**: Added Yellow, Orange, and Purple to the original Red, Green, Blue palette (Level 2 enhancement).
- **Enhanced Debug Tools**: 
  - Toggle debug mode to visualize individual HSV masks for each color.
  - Display a combined HSV mask for all detected colors.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Supports real-time color detection via webcam.
- **Data Export**: Exports detection results (color names, RGB values, bounding box coordinates) as a Pandas DataFrame and CSV.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Streamlit-based UI for uploading media and toggling debug options.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core language for implementation.
- **OpenCV**: Handles image/video processing and color detection.
- **NumPy**: Manages array operations for HSV ranges and masks.
- **Pandas**: Organizes detection results for export.
- **Streamlit**: Provides an interactive web interface.
